		<description><![CDATA[Would it be possible to include a Resources list at the end of the article with links to the original studies? The articles discussing the articles help, but it helps more if there are links to the actual studies. 

This is a great article and I&#039;d love to send it to our leadership team, but they sometimes shoot this kind of thing down too easily if it seems like speculation without study links to back it up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have found that the most productive way to work for me is what I call &quot;binge working&quot;.  I am a freelance software developer so I have the flexibility to make my own schedule.  Rather than working some kind of arbitrary set hours, I choose a goal for the day and go after it until I finish it.  It takes me a couple hours to get into the &quot;flow&quot; work state, but once I am there I want to stay there for as long as I can.  I can get more done in that chunk of time (4 - 12 hours), than I can working in smaller, disconnected sprints.]]></description>
